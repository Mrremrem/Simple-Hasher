# String-Hasher
I made this program for myself, however, I thought I would just upload it in case if anyone out there wants to play with it. 

This program uses Stephan Brumme's implementation of a hashing library which can be found here: https://github.com/stbrumme/hash-library. All this program does is output its contents. 

# Compiling
To compile this program, you will need:
1. [Cmake] (https://cmake.org/)
2. Some C++ compiler like Clang++ that can get the job done
